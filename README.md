# update_scanner
The Ultimate System &amp; Software Update Scanner is a powerful Windows utility designed to keep your system secure and up to date by identifying outdated software and drivers. With its intuitive interface and detailed logging, this tool makes system maintenance simple and efficient.

## Features

- **Software Update Detection**: Scans all installed software on your Windows system and checks for available updates
- **Driver Update Detection**: Scans for installed drivers and checks for available updates
- **Clean Interface**: Displays results in an organized, tabbed interface
- **Actionable Results**: Double-click on items with available updates to open the relevant update page or launcher
- **Detailed Logging**: Keeps a log of all scanning activities for troubleshooting

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - tkinter (usually included with Python)
  - requests

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system
2. No additional installation is required - the program is portable

## Usage

1. Double-click the `run_update_scanner.bat` file to start the program
2. Click the "Scan for Updates" button to begin scanning your system
3. View the results in the respective tabs:
   - **Software**: Shows all installed software and available updates
   - **Drivers**: Shows installed drivers and available updates
   - **Log**: Displays detailed logging information
4. Double-click on any item with an "Update Available" status to open the relevant update page or launcher

## How It Works

The scanner uses several methods to detect installed software and drivers:

- **Software Detection**: Scans the Windows registry for installed applications
- **Driver Detection**: Uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to query driver information

For update checking, the program currently uses a simulation approach for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, it would connect to vendor APIs or websites to check for the latest versions.

## Notes

- The update checking functionality is currently simulated for demonstration purposes
- Some software might not be detected if installed in non-standard locations
- The program requires administrative privileges to access certain registry keys and system information

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual update checking via vendor APIs
- Add automatic update functionality where possible
- Improve detection of non-standard installations
