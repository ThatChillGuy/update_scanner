## Features

- **Comprehensive Software Update Detection**: Scans all installed software on your Windows system and checks for available updates
- **GitHub API Integration**: Automatically checks GitHub repositories for the latest releases of supported software
- **Driver Update Detection**: Identifies outdated drivers that might affect system performance and stability
- **Clean, Intuitive Interface**: Displays results in an organized, tabbed interface for easy navigation
- **Actionable Results**: Double-click on items with available updates to open the relevant update page or launcher
- **Detailed Logging**: Keeps a log of all scanning activities for troubleshooting and audit purposes
- **Portable Application**: No installation required - run directly from any location

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Runtime**: Python 3.6 or higher
- **Required Python Packages**:
  - tkinter (usually included with Python installation)
  - requests (for network operations)
  - packaging (for version comparison, automatically installed if missing)
- **Permissions**: Administrative privileges required for complete system scanning

## Quick Start

1. Double-click the `run_update_scanner.bat` file
2. Click the "Scan for Updates" button
3. Review the results and update your software as needed

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system
   - You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
2. No additional installation is required - the program is portable and can be run from any location
3. If the required Python packages are not installed, you can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

1. **Starting the Application**:
   - Double-click the `run_update_scanner.bat` file to start the program
   - Alternatively, you can run the main Python script directly if you prefer

2. **Scanning for Updates**:
   - Click the "Scan for Updates" button to begin scanning your system
   - The scan may take several minutes depending on the number of installed applications

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - Results are displayed in three tabs:
     - **Software**: Shows all installed software and available updates
     - **Drivers**: Shows installed drivers and available updates
     - **Log**: Displays detailed logging information for troubleshooting

4. **Taking Action**:
   - Double-click on any item with an "Update Available" status to open the relevant update page or launcher
   - Items with "Up to Date" status require no action

5. **Saving Results**:
   - Use the "Save Report" button to export the scan results to a text file for future reference

## How It Works

The scanner uses several methods to detect installed software and drivers:

- **Software Detection**: 
  - Scans the Windows registry for installed applications
  - Checks common installation directories
  - Identifies application version information from executable metadata

- **Driver Detection**: 
  - Uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to query driver information
  - Checks driver version against known latest versions

- **Update Checking**:
  - Uses the GitHub API to check for updates for software with GitHub repositories
  - Maps installed software to known GitHub repositories for real-time update checking
  - Compares version numbers to determine if updates are available
  - For software without GitHub repositories, uses a simulation approach for demonstration

## Troubleshooting

- **Program Won't Start**:
  - Ensure Python is correctly installed and added to your PATH
  - Try running the script directly from the command line to see any error messages

- **Missing Software**:
  - Some software might not be detected if installed in non-standard locations
  - Applications installed for the current user only might not be detected when running as administrator

- **False Positives**:
  - The update detection system may occasionally report false positives
  - Always verify with the software vendor's website before updating

- **Performance Issues**:
  - If scanning is slow, try closing other applications to free up system resources
  - Consider excluding certain directories if they contain many applications you don't need to track

## FAQ

**Q: Does this program automatically update my software?**  
A: No, it only detects available updates. You must manually update each application.

**Q: Is an internet connection required?**  
A: Yes, to check for the latest versions of software and drivers.

**Q: Will this work with portable applications?**  
A: The scanner primarily detects installed applications. Portable apps may not be detected unless they're in standard locations.

**Q: How often should I run the scanner?**  
A: We recommend running it weekly to ensure your system stays up-to-date.

**Q: Does this replace Windows Update?**  
A: No, this complements Windows Update by checking for updates to third-party software that Windows Update doesn't cover.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand GitHub repository mapping for more software applications
- Add support for additional version control platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- Add automatic update functionality where possible
- Improve detection of non-standard installations
- Add scheduling capabilities to run scans automatically
- Implement a silent mode for background operation
- Add export options in various formats (CSV, HTML, PDF)
